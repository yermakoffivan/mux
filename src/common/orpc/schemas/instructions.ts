/**
 * Schemas for instruction context (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.local.md, …).
 *
 * These are the single source of truth for both:
 * - The internal data structure used by `buildSystemMessage` to compose the
 *   system prompt (so each layer is typed instead of being string-soup).
 * - The IPC payload returned by `workspace.getInstructions` and consumed by
 *   the right-sidebar Instructions tab.
 *
 * Inferring the TypeScript types via `z.infer` (re-exported from
 * `@/common/types/instructions`) guarantees the panel and the prompt builder
 * speak the exact same shape — adding a field to one place forces every
 * consumer to handle it.
