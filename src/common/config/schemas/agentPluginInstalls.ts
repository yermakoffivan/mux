/**
 * Managed Agent Plugin install registry — persisted as `~/.mux/plugins.json`
 * with the shape `{ plugins: AgentPluginInstallEntry[] }`.
 *
 * A standalone file (not a `~/.mux/config.json` section) on purpose: older
 * builds rebuild config.json from known fields on every save, so a downgrade
 * would silently drop an embedded registry. A file older builds never touch
 * survives upgrade↔downgrade round-trips. The install service additionally
 * rewrites the file from its RAW entry list (entries validated per-element
 * on read, matched by `name` on mutation), so entries and fields written by
 * newer builds survive mutations on this build.
 *
 * Semantics (mirroring lazy.nvim / Claude Code): `source.ref` is the tracking
 * channel and `lockedSha` is what is actually on disk and runs. Install
 * resolves ref → SHA and records both; the runtime never follows a branch
 * implicitly — updates apply only on explicit user action.
 *
 * The registry only annotates installs. Plugin discovery
 * (src/node/services/agentPlugins/discovery.ts) remains the source of truth
 * for what loads, so drift between registry and disk self-heals: directories
 * without a registry entry show as "unmanaged", entries without a directory
 * show as "missing".
